        <p>
          I was born and grew up in a remote village of Nepal.
          I completed my highschool from my village school and then paved
          all the way to capital city,Kathmandu, for my undergraduate degree.
          I came to United States for my higher education and completed my master
          degree in Biology in 2013.
          <br />
          Now-a-days, I am working for Agilent Technologies INC as a production associate.
          we design genetic probe for cancer research and diagnostic.<br />
          we also formulate and make Wash Buffers for Microarray testing which is utilized
          and sold throught out the world for arrey testing. Some of my other works also include
          SureSelect buffer preparation and SureFISH testing.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Currently enrolled in full stack web development course organized my UT Austin coding boot camp and honing
          skills on front and back end web development, with concentration on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Nodejs.
          Back end development would also focus on server side technologies including Nodejs, reactjs, angularjs and
          PHP.

        </p>
        <p> I started learning about websites design by myself almost three years ago. It gave me immence pleasure to
          desing and style client's websites. When I started researching about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I realized that
          web design is something I can develop my career on. A little after that, I discovered about UT Austin coding
          bootcamp, which I immediately
          jumped to join in.
          Now, I feel very proud that I have join this program which will help me flourish my career as a full stack
          developer.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Besides these, I have different hobies that I would like to do during my free time. One of the most
          interested hobies is travelling across the world and explore about the world culture and
          heritage. Eventhough, I haven't travelled so many countries, I would like to visit Europe and South
          America if I could afford it.</p>
        <p> Apart from my career and future, I am also interested in politics and I wish I could join one of the
          major policical system which could benefits our country. But dirty games of politics alway restrain me to
          stay away from it.
