          <p>I was born and grew up in a remote village of Nepal.
          I completed my highschool from my village school and then paved 
          all the way to capital city,Kathmandu, for my undergraduate degree.
          I came to United States for my higher education and completed my master
          degree in Biology in 2013.
          Now-a-days, I am working for Agilent Technologies INC as a production associate.
          we design genetic probe for cancer research and diagnostic.
          we also formulate and make Wash Buffers for Microarray testing which is utilized
          and sold throught out the world for arrey testing. Some of my other works also include
          SureSelect buffer preparation and SureFISH testing.
          Besides these, I am also enrolled in a Full Stack coding boot camp program at UT Austin 
          and learing to code. I am really interested and excited about this program because it is
          this program is teaching how computer world works and speaks to the clients.</p>
          <p>I have different hobies that I would like to do during my free time. One of the most 
            interested hobies is travelling across the world and explore about the world culture and 
            heritage. Eventhough, I haven't travelled so many countries, I would like to visit Europe and South 
            America if I could afford it.</p>
            <p> Besides my career and future, I al also interested in politics and I wish I could join one of the 
              major policical system which could benefits our country. But dirty games of politics alway restrain me to 
              stay from it.
