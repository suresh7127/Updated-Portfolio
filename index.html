        <p> I started learning about websites design by myself almost three years ago. It gave me immence pleasure to
          desing and style client's websites. When I started researching about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I realized that
          web design is something I can develop my career on. A little after that, I discovered about UT Austin coding
          bootcamp, which I immediately
          jumped to join in.
          Now, I feel very proud that I have join this program which will help me flourish my career as a full stack
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked on main three projects so far:<br>
          1. Project 1: My Daily Dash -
          This was our first group project where were created an app for user's daily activities.<br>
          The purpose of this project was to give user an app for their routine management so that
          they can accomplish their daily goal on time.<br>
          Another interesting fact about the project was to give user rewards points if they achieve their goal on
          time.<br>
          We used firebase database and google authentication for user's data management. Managing data on firebase and
          providing log in information to user's identity were the most challenging parts of this project.<br>
          However, several hours of rigorous of work team members achieved these goals and we feel very proud of our
          teamwork.
          <br>
          <br>
          2. Train Scheduler: This was another interesting project that I worked on to display the time schedule of any
          train system.<br>
          I utilized JavaScript, jQuery and Moment.js to achieve this goal.<br>
          Working with moment.js was another interesting fact that I learned during this project.<br>
          Most Challenging part of this project was to set up time updates of the train schedule which i achieved with
          moment.js.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          3. Gif Tastic: This was my best project and i feel so proud that I achieved this goal.<br>
          Although, it was a bit challenging, i am happy to show that hard work let us accomplish our goal.<br>
          Getting the Json data and implementing it with my project with associated key were very difficult to
          achieve.<br>
          However, the knowledge that I gained during my course work at UT Austin coding Bootcamp help to attain those
          goal.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Besides these, I have different hobies that I would like to do during my free time. One of the most
          interested hobies is travelling across the world and explore about the world culture and
          heritage. Eventhough, I haven't travelled so many countries, I would like to visit Europe and South
          America if I could afford it.</p>
        <p> Apart from my career and future, I am also interested in politics and I wish I could join one of the
          major policical system which could benefits our country. But dirty games of politics alway restrain me to
          stay away from it.
