        <p> I started learning about websites design by myself almost three years ago. It gave me immence pleasure to
          desing and style client's websites. When I started researching about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I realized that
          web design is something I can develop my career on. A little after that, I discovered about UT Austin coding
          bootcamp, which I immediately
          jumped to join in.

          interested hobies is travelling across the world and explore about the world culture and
          heritage. Eventhough, I haven't travelled so many countries, I would like to visit Europe and South
          America if I could afford it.</p>

          stay away from it.
