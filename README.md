Another interesting fact about the project was to give user rewards points if they achieve their goal on time.<br>
We used firebase database and google authentication for user's data management. Managing data on firebase and providing log in information to user's identity were the most challenging parts of this project.<br>
However, several hours of rigorous of work team members achieved these goals and we feel very proud of our teamwork.

2.	Train Scheduler: This was another interesting project that I worked on to display the time schedule of any train system.<br>

<br>
I utilized JavaScript, jQuery and Moment.js to achieve this goal.<br>
Working with moment.js was another interesting fact that I learned during this project.<br>
Most Challenging part of this project was to set up time updates of the train schedule which i achieved with moment.js.<br>
<br>
3.	Gif Tastic: This was my best project and i feel so proud that I achieved this goal.<br>
Although, it was a bit challenging, i am happy to show that hard work let us accomplish our goal.<br>
Getting the Json data and implementing it with my project with associated key were very difficult to achieve.<br>
However, the knowledge that I gained during my course work at UT Austin coding Bootcamp help to attain those goal.<br>
